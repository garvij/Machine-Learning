- by default 100 elements
linspace(1,2) - 100 elements including 1 and 2
linspace(1,2,n) - n points including 1 and 2

imp functions
sum(): sums over rows for each column
mean(): mean over rows for each column
var(): variance over rows for each column

matlab equality test between a vector and a single number
%examples!
tp = sum((cvPredictions ==1) & (yval == 1));
fp = sum((cvPredictions ==1) & (yval == 0));
